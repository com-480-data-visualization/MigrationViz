## Problematic
The public scene is often polarized and emotionally charged around the subject of migration. Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain "unbiased" (we are aware that this does not exist strictly speaking) data-driven information on the subject. We are interested in unveiling the order of magnitude of global migration, without overlooking the fact that each incident involves a real person. Better knowledge of migrations flows, statistics, etc. can add value to the discussions on migration in our society and our perception of the subject. 

In order to shed light on various factors of migration, we have worked with different sources. We start with data from the United Nations to give you an understanding of the extent of the term 'migration'. While this term is often associated with refugees, this is only a small fraction of all people who migrate. In a second step, we present data from the European network 'UNITED'. This data shows a completely different, terrible side of today's migration policy. With this visualization, we hope to give a voice to people who are otherwise less heard. 

## Target Audience
Our target audience ranges from curious internet travelers to future data-viz students stumbling upon our website in search of inspiration. We hope the visualizations give other people (and ourselves!) new input and perspectives to reflect upon, raise awareness and maybe even act as a conversation starter. In the future, those visualizations could potentially be useful for NGOs or citizens interested in human migration and data visualization.

To run our project locally, you need to do:

- Clone the repo
- Move into the ```website``` folder
- Start a local server (e.g. using ```http-server```)

## Dataset Sources
For the first two visualizations, we used data from the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock), available in open source on their webpage. For the Map of deaths, the data was provided by [UNITED](https://unitedagainstrefugeedeaths.eu/). They were sent to us as an Excel file upon request.
